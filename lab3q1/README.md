# CHK121COMlab3q1SimpleBillingFromXML
Python program to implement a simple billing system. 
Input data file for the billing system in XML format 
(http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~dcywchan/1718SemB121COM/client.xml) 
contains a name, address, transaction type, and amount of transaction. 
The transaction type is either C (for credit) or D (for debit). 
The transaction amount is given in dollars and cents. 
If we assume each person's balance is initially zero, 
that a credit reduces the balance, and a debit increases the balance, 
the computer program should produce a report, ordered on name, 
giving the final balance in dollars and cents in each account. 
If a balance is exactly zero, 
then that person's balance *should* not appear in the report.
